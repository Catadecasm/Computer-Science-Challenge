#### Link: https://leetcode.com/Catadecasm/


In the following repository you will find the source code of the four exercises performed for this challenge. In the header of each file you will see a description of the time and space analysis in terms of complexity.

However, they will be briefly described here.


### Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes

- Time complexity is O(V * (V + E))
- Space complexity is O(V)

### Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values

- Time complexity is O(n)
- Space complexity is O(n)

### Path with Maximum Gold

- Time complexity is O(mn^2)
- Space complexity is O(mn)

### Longest Valid Parentheses

- Time complexity is O(n^2)
- Space complexity is O(n)

##

#### Note: 
- The Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes algorithm passed 49 / 51 of the testcases.
- The Longest Valid Parentheses algorithm passed 230 / 231 of the testcases.
- Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values algorithm passed all testcases
- The Path with Maximum Gold algorithm passed all testcases.
